name: Enforce Conventions

# - About ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# CI/CD GitHub Action to enforce branch naming conventions.
#
# The workflow will parse the name of every branch except for main and staging
# whenever code is pushed to the remote. If the branch name does not follow any
# accepted convention, this workflow will fail. The purpose of these validation
# rules is to ensure that branch names are CLI compliant.
#
# See resources below for assistance.
